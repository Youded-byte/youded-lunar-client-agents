# Agents for Lunar Client
My agents for lunar-client, best used with [lunar-client-qt](https://github.com/Youded-byte/lunar-client-qt).

## LunarAccurateReachDisplay

## LunarPerformance

## LunarBetterHurtCam
[LunarBetterHurtCam](https://github.com/Youded-byte/LunarBetterHurtCam) is included in my fork of [lunar-client-qt](https://github.com/Youded-byte/lunar-client-qt) and is therefore not included in this repo.

## FastPlace
[FastPlace](https://github.com/Youded-byte/FastPlace-Agent) is not included in this repo because it is considered a cheat on many servers. You can download it from it's own repo.
